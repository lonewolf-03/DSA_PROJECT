In this project we applied the conectps we studied in the Data Structures and Algorithms course CMPN102 in Spring Semester 2023 by simulating a simple multiprocessor system. The document that describes 
the project can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MGKfCWCv1HpQ30vOlOghCRcJZ1W1KU87/view. The simulation was implemented in C++.

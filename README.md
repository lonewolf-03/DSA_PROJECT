In this project we applied the conectps we studied in the Data Structures and Algorithms course CMPN102 in Spring Semester 2023 by simulating a simple multiprocessor system. The document that describes 
the project can be viewed here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ayman-4459011b9/. The simulation was implemented in C++.
